    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>The core language we teach is JavaScript, and we teach our students HTML, CSS, Node, Angular, Express and Databasing in MySQL/MongoDB. However what we value most is that our students learn how to think like a programmer, how to solve problems, and how to manage a project. With this fundamental knowledge our students should be ready for their first web-developer job.</p>
